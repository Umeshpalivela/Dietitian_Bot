## Introduction
- The online artificial dietician is a bot with artificial intelligence about human diets. It acts as a diet consultant similar to a real dietician. 
- Dieticians are educated with nutrient value of foods. A dietician consults a person based on his schedule, body type, height and weight. The system too asks all this data from the user and processes it. It asks user's height, weight, age etc.
-  The system stores and processes this data and then calculates the nutrient value needed to fill up user's needs. 
- The system then shows an appropriate diet to the users and asks if user is ok with it, else it shows other alternate diets to fill up user's needs.
